   abstract = {A prominent issue at present is that entities from different sectors struggle to find efficient and reliable method to detect fake news online. Mis-information seriously impacts society, especially in areas like politics and education. The proposed work addresses the issue of false news by developing a detection model based on multiple classification algorithms. The rapid spread of information and news through instant sharing has contributed to the exponential rise in its misrepresentation. We begin by addressing the consequences of fake news. Thereafter, we discuss the datasets utilized in previous findings along with their NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques such as N-gram analysis, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), word2vec, Data pre-processing, Tokenization, Normalization, Regex, Lemmatization, and Generalization. After analysing several studies on fake news detection, we have identified the most frequently used models, such as LSTM-RNN (Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network), Naïve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Passive Aggressive Classifier, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors), LSVM (Linear Support Vector Machine), LR (Logistic Regression), and Decision Tree. As evidenced, the SVM and Bi-directional LSTM-RNN (Long Short-Term Memory-Recurrent Neural Network) model achieved the highest accuracy of 100%, whereas the lowest accuracy, 47.2%, was observed with the KNN and SVM models when utilizing four-gram word features. The outcomes of this research helps to strengthen the efficiency of false news detection methods.},

   abstract = {The paper discusses the results of a study which explored advanced learners of English engagement with their mobile devices to develop learning experiences that meet their needs and goals as foreign language learners. The data were collected from 20 students by means of a semi-structured interview. The gathered data were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results of the study demonstrated that, on the one hand, some subjects manifested heightened awareness relating to the advantageous role of mobile devices in their learning endeavors, their ability to reach for suitable tools and retrieve necessary information so as to achieve their goals, meet their needs and adjust their learning of English to their personal learning styles, and on the other, a rather intuitive and/or ad hoc use of their mobile devices in the classroom.},

   abstract = {In order to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on higher education, we surveyed approximately 1,500 students at one of the largest public institutions in the United States using an instrument designed to recover the causal impact of the pandemic on students' current and expected outcomes. Results show large negative effects across many dimensions. Due to COVID-19: 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% lost a job, internship, or a job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35. Moreover, these effects have been highly heterogeneous. One quarter of students increased their study time by more than 4 hours per week due to COVID-19, while another quarter decreased their study time by more than 5 hours per week. This heterogeneity often followed existing socioeconomic divides; lower-income students are 55% more likely to have delayed graduation due to COVID-19 than their higher-income peers. Finally, we show that the economic and health related shocks induced by COVID-19 vary systematically by socioeconomic factors and constitute key mediators in explaining the large (and heterogeneous) effects of the pandemic.},

Theories used in this research are theory of behavior information seeking also use and gratification theory, the concepts of research are new media, e-commerce and consumer behavior. This research is qualitative. The data were collected using in-depth interviews of 8 young women in Jakarta between the ages of 25-35 years and already working. This research uses phenomenology method and uses source triangulation for data validity. The results showed that there are two groups of consumers are smart online shopping behavior and moderate online shopping behavior.},
